NotifyOn
==========

![](https://api.travis-ci.org/BrilliantChemistry/NotifyOn.svg?branch=overhaul)

NotifyOn generates automatic notifications as a result of state changes on a
particular model in a Rails application. It supports email messages, along with
third-party real-time delivery, while also storing each notification in your
database so you can use, adjust, and display as you'd wish.

Documentation can be found in [the wiki
library](https://github.com/digerata/NotifyOn/wiki). A good place to start is
[this article](https://github.com/BrilliantChemistry/NotifyOn/wiki/Getting-Started).
