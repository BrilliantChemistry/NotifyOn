NotifyOn
==========

**This branch represents the bleeding edge. It is not production-ready.**

NotifyOn generates automatic notifications as a result of state changes on a
particular model in a Rails application. It supports email messages, along with
third-party real-time delivery, while also storing each notification in your
database so you can use, adjust, and display as you'd wish.

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/digerata/NotifyOn/wiki) for
documentation.
