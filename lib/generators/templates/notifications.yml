# This is the file that lets you configure notifications in bulk, instead of
# using individual "notify_on" calls within your models.
#
# Do so by first specifying the underscored class name, and give each
# notification a name. For example:
#
# message:
#   message_sent:
#     on: :create
#     to: :user
#     from: :author
#     message: {author.first_name} has sent you a message.
#     link: chat_path(:chat)
#     email:
#       template: new_message
#       send_unless:  :pusher_recipient_active?
#
